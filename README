Running instructions:
It is very important that all images and other files are in the same
directory as the source code or the game/solver will not work.
To run the game navigate to its stored directory and in the terminal type
python3 minesweeper_v7.py to run the game where you will be prompted
to choose a size, mine count, and whether the user or the solver is playing.
If the user is chosen: left click to open a tile, right click to flag likely mine
spots and keep left clicking until the whole board is open or a mine is clicked.
The numbers on the board represent adjacent mines to that particular tile.
If the solver is chosen: do the same as above except you won't need to flag
and only click on the green tile as the solver has deemed that tile the safest click.

Notes and assumptions:
For the game:
If the mine count chosen is too high then the code
may get hung up giving you a first click spot as we run an infinite loop until
the value of the tile clicked is 0
Also be sure to follow the game's instructions on the size of the board.
For the Solver:
Be sure to follow the green tile, but if you accidentally click another tile then
the original green tile will not disappear instead it will stay where it was and a new
green tile will be generated.
Also the solver does not have 100% accuracy so don't expect to win every game played using it.
